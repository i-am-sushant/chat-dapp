Now can you give me detailed list of all the tech stack used in this project?

GitHub Copilot: Okay, based on the project files, here's a detailed list of the tech stack used:

**1. Frontend Core Technologies:**

*   **HTML:** The structure of the web application (as seen in `dist/index.html`).
*   **CSS:** For styling the application. While not explicitly shown in a separate CSS file in the provided context, Bootstrap provides the primary styling.
*   **JavaScript:** The core language for browser interactivity. The application logic is written in TypeScript and then transpiled to JavaScript (`dist/bundle.js`).

**2. JavaScript Libraries & Frameworks:**

*   **jQuery (`jquery: ^3.5.0`):** A utility library for DOM manipulation and event handling. Used extensively in index.ts for interacting with HTML elements.
*   **PeerJS (`peerjs: ^1.3.1`):** The core library enabling WebRTC peer-to-peer communication, which is fundamental to the decentralized nature of the chat. Used in index.ts to establish connections and send/receive data.
*   **localForage (`localforage: ^1.8.1`):** A library for client-side data storage, providing a simple API over IndexedDB, WebSQL, or localStorage. While not directly used in the file-sharing feature we just added, it's listed as a dependency, suggesting its use for other features like message persistence (as mentioned in the README.md todo list).

**3. Styling & UI:**

*   **Bootstrap (`bootstrap: ^4.5.0`):** A popular CSS framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides pre-styled components and a grid system, evident from the class names used in `dist/index.html`.
*   **Font Awesome (`@fortawesome/fontawesome-free: ^5.14.0`):** A library for vector icons, likely used for UI elements like status indicators or buttons.

**4. Build Tools & Development Environment:**

*   **Node.js & npm:** The runtime environment and package manager for JavaScript. Used to manage project dependencies (listed in package.json) and run build scripts.
*   **TypeScript (`typescript: ^3.9.7`):** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. The application's logic in index.ts is written in TypeScript. The configuration is in tsconfig.json.
*   **webpack (`webpack: ^4.44.1`):** A static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies (like your TypeScript files and libraries) and generates optimized static assets (like `dist/bundle.js`). The configuration is in webpack.config.js.
*   **webpack-cli (`webpack-cli: ^3.3.12`):** The command-line interface for webpack, allowing you to run webpack commands from the terminal.
*   **ts-loader (`ts-loader: ^6.2.2`):** A webpack loader that tells webpack how to process TypeScript files and transpile them using the TypeScript compiler.
*   **cross-env:** A utility to set environment variables (like `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`) in a cross-platform compatible way within npm scripts (used in the `build` script in package.json).

**5. Version Control:**

*   **Git:** Implied by the presence of a .gitignore file and the repository information in package.json. Used for source code management.

This stack is typical for a modern web application that aims for type safety (TypeScript), modularity (webpack), and rich client-side interactions with P2P capabilities.

i-am-sushant: is it connecting to any external server at any point ? What is the decentralised nature of the project? How is it storing messages and files shared? inside browser or somewhere else? what is the limit?

GitHub Copilot: Let's break down these aspects of the project:

**1. External Server Connection:**

*   **Signaling Server (PeerJS):** Yes, at the very beginning of establishing a connection, PeerJS typically connects to a "signaling server" (also known as a broker server).
    *   **Purpose:** This server's job is **not** to relay your chat messages or files. Its primary role is to help the two browsers (peers) find each other on the internet and exchange the necessary information (like IP addresses and capabilities) to establish a direct WebRTC connection.
    *   **Default Behavior:** In your `src/index.ts`, PeerJS is initialized like this: `peer = new Peer(uid, { debug: 3 });`. Since no specific host or port for a signaling server is provided, it will use the **default public PeerJS cloud-hosted signaling server.**
    *   **After Connection:** Once the direct WebRTC connection is established between the two users, the signaling server is generally no longer involved in their communication for that session. All subsequent chat messages and file data travel directly peer-to-peer.
*   **Serving Static Assets:** When you first open the application (e.g., by running `npx serve dist` and opening `localhost:PORT`), you are connecting to a local web server on your machine (or wherever the `dist` folder is hosted) to download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (`bundle.js`) files. This is standard for any web application and is separate from the P2P communication.

**2. Decentralized Nature of the Project:**

*   **Data Exchange:** The core decentralized aspect is that **once a connection is established, chat messages and file data are exchanged directly between the users' browsers (peer-to-peer) using WebRTC data channels.** This data does not pass through a central server.
*   **Connection Setup:** The reliance on a signaling server for the initial handshake is a point of centralization for the *discovery and connection setup phase*. Without it, peers would have a very hard time finding each other. Many WebRTC applications use this model.
*   **"Purely static web app, for P2P communication":** This description from `package.json` highlights that the application code itself can be hosted on any simple static web server, and the *communication* part is P2P.

**3. Storage of Messages and Files Shared:**

*   **Messages:**
    *   **In Memory/DOM:** During an active session, messages are added to the chatbox in the HTML DOM and are thus held in the browser's memory for display.
    *   **`localForage` (Potential Persistent Storage):** The project includes `localforage` as a dependency, and the `README.md` mentions "Message persistence using localForage" as a TODO. If this feature were fully implemented, `localforage` would store messages in the **user's browser storage** (IndexedDB, WebSQL, or localStorage, depending on browser support and `localforage`'s preference). This makes messages persist between sessions *on that specific browser*. It's still local to the user, not on a central server.
    *   **Current Implementation:** Based on the code we've focused on, the explicit saving and loading of messages using `localForage` isn't visible in the main interaction flow, so messages might be ephemeral (lost when the tab is closed) unless that TODO was completed elsewhere.
*   **Files Shared:**
    *   **Sender:** The sender reads the file directly from their local file system when they select it.
    *   **During Transfer:** Chunks of the file are held in JavaScript variables (in the browser's memory) on both the sending and receiving end.
    *   **Receiver:** When all chunks are received, they are assembled into a `Blob` in the **receiver's browser memory**.
    *   **Downloading:** The `URL.createObjectURL(blob)` creates a temporary, in-memory URL for this `Blob`, allowing the user to download it to their local file system via the browser's download mechanism.
    *   **No Automatic Persistent Storage of Files:** The project does **not** automatically store the received files in the browser's local storage (like `localForage`) or on any server. The file exists in the receiver's browser memory until they download it and then it's up to them to save it on their computer. The temporary object URL is also revoked eventually by the browser or when the page is closed.

**4. Limits:**

*   **Message Storage (with `localForage`):**
    *   Browser storage limits apply. `localStorage` is typically around 5-10MB. IndexedDB (which `localforage` often prefers) can store much more, often hundreds of MBs or even GBs, but it's subject to browser quotas and user permissions.
*   **File Sharing Size:**
    *   **WebRTC Data Channels:** While WebRTC can handle large amounts of data, there are practical limits. Sending extremely large files (many gigabytes) can be unreliable without very sophisticated chunking, acknowledgment, and error recovery mechanisms.
    *   **Browser Memory:** The most significant practical limit in this implementation is the **receiver's browser memory**. All file chunks are accumulated in memory before being assembled into a `Blob`. If a file is too large, it can crash the browser tab due to excessive memory consumption. This limit varies greatly depending on the user's device and browser, but files beyond a few hundred megabytes might start causing issues. The current basic flow control helps a bit but isn't designed for massive files.
    *   **No Hardcoded Limit:** There isn't a specific file size limit coded into the application, but these practical browser and WebRTC constraints exist.
*   **Number of Peers:** The current UI and connection logic in `src/index.ts` are primarily designed for one-to-one connections. Supporting group chats with multiple peers would require significant changes to connection management and data broadcasting logic.
*   **Signaling Server:** If using the public PeerJS signaling server, there might be undocumented rate limits or capacity constraints if the application were to have a very large number of users trying to connect simultaneously. For a production application with many users, hosting your own PeerJS server is recommended.

i-am-sushant: So if i understand it right, right now it uses localstorage and if i set it up to use localforage i can make use of indexdDB which will store significantly more messages and files persistently in the browser. Also I can setup my own signalling server so that I can get better connection speed. Am I right? correct me wherever i am wrong.

GitHub Copilot: You're on the right track with some of those ideas, but let's clarify a few points:

1.  **Current Storage (`localStorage` vs. `localForage`):**
    *   **Correction:** Right now, for the chat messages and files we've been working on, the application primarily holds data **in memory** during an active session. Messages appear in the chatbox (DOM), and files are assembled in memory for download.
    *   The project *includes* `localforage` as a dependency, and the `README.md` mentions "Message persistence using localForage" as a TODO. If this feature were fully implemented, `localforage` would indeed be the tool used.
    *   `localforage` is a wrapper that intelligently chooses the best available client-side storage: IndexedDB, WebSQL, or `localStorage` (often preferring IndexedDB if available). So, by using `localforage`, you'd likely be leveraging IndexedDB by default on modern browsers.

2.  **`localForage`, IndexedDB, and Storing Messages/Files Persistently:**
    *   **Messages:** You are **correct**. If you implement the message persistence feature using `localforage`, it can store a significantly larger number of messages persistently in the browser (likely using IndexedDB) compared to `localStorage` alone. Users could then see their past messages when they reopen the app in the same browser.
    *   **Files:**
        *   **Correction/Clarification:** While `localforage` *can* store binary data like `Blob`s (which is how files are represented), the current file-sharing design is for **direct transfer and then user-initiated download to their computer's file system.** It does **not** automatically save the shared files into the browser's persistent storage (like IndexedDB) after transfer.
        *   You *could* modify it to save files into IndexedDB using `localforage`, but this would be a different feature. You'd need to consider the user experience (users might not expect files to be saved within the browser's internal storage automatically) and storage quotas.

3.  **Setting Up Your Own Signaling Server:**
    *   **Correction/Clarification:** You are **partially right**. Setting up your own signaling server (e.g., by running the PeerServer yourself) has several benefits:
        *   **Reliability and Control:** You are not dependent on the public PeerJS cloud server, which might have usage limits or downtime.
        *   **Potentially Faster Connection *Setup*:** If your users are geographically closer to your signaling server than to the public one, the initial handshake to establish the P2P connection *might* be slightly faster and more reliable.
        *   **Privacy of Signaling Data:** The metadata exchanged during connection setup (like IP addresses) goes through your server.
    *   **Impact on Data Transfer Speed:** However, the signaling server is **not** typically involved in relaying the actual chat messages or file data once the direct P2P connection is established. The *speed of the data transfer itself* (messages, files) is primarily determined by the direct network conditions (bandwidth, latency) between the two connected peers. So, your own signaling server won't directly make the file bytes travel faster peer-to-peer, but it can contribute to a more robust and potentially quicker start to the P2P session.

**In summary:**

*   Using `localforage` is the way to go for robust persistent message storage in the browser, likely leveraging IndexedDB.
*   The current file sharing is for direct transfer and download, not persistent in-browser storage of files (though that's technically possible to add).
*   An own signaling server improves reliability and control over the connection setup process, but doesn't directly increase the P2P data transfer throughput.

i-am-sushant: So based on our talk right now give me a list of future upgrades that can be made to the project.

GitHub Copilot: Okay, based on our conversation, here's a list of potential future upgrades for the decentralized chat project:

**1. Enhanced Data Persistence & Management:**

*   **Full Message Persistence:** Implement the "Message persistence using localForage" feature mentioned in the `README.md`. This would involve saving messages to the browser's IndexedDB (via `localForage`) and loading them when the app starts, allowing users to see their chat history.
*   **Persistent File Storage (Optional):** Consider an option for users to save received files directly into their browser's storage (using `localForage` for `Blob`s), perhaps with a clear UI to manage these stored files and their quotas.
*   **Clear Chat History/Stored Data:** Add functionality for users to clear their locally stored messages or files.

**2. Improved P2P Connection & Reliability:**

*   **Self-Hosted Signaling Server:** Deploy and configure the application to use your own instance of PeerServer. This would give you more control, potentially better reliability for connection setup, and avoid reliance on the public PeerJS server.
*   **Connection Re-establishment Logic:** Implement more robust logic to attempt to re-establish a P2P connection if it drops unexpectedly.
*   **STUN/TURN Server Configuration:** Allow for more advanced configuration of STUN/TURN servers (beyond what PeerJS might do by default) to improve NAT traversal and connection success rates, especially for users behind restrictive firewalls.

**3. Advanced File Sharing Features:**

*   **Robust Flow Control & Acknowledgments:** Implement a proper acknowledgment system for file chunks to manage sending speed effectively, prevent buffer overflows, and ensure more reliable transfer of large files.
*   **File Transfer Error Handling & Resumption:** Add better error detection during file transfer (e.g., if a peer disconnects mid-transfer) and potentially the ability to resume interrupted transfers.
*   **Sender-Side Progress & Cancellation:** Display progress for the sender as well and allow them to cancel an ongoing file transfer.
*   **Multiple File Selection/Sending:** Allow users to select and send multiple files at once.
*   **Drag and Drop File Sharing:** Implement drag-and-drop functionality for selecting files to share.

**4. User Interface & User Experience (UI/UX) Enhancements:**

*   **Improved Visual Feedback:** Enhance UI cues for connection status, file transfer progress (both sending and receiving), and errors.
*   **User Presence Indicators:** Show which users are currently connected or available.
*   **Notifications:** Implement browser notifications for new messages or incoming file transfers when the app window is not active.
*   **User List/Management:** If expanding to more than two peers, a user list would be essential.
*   **Emoji Support/Rich Text:** Enhance the chat input with more formatting options.

**5. Multi-Peer & Group Functionality:**

*   **Group Chat:** Extend the P2P logic to support connections with multiple peers simultaneously for group chat functionality. This would require a more complex mesh or star network topology for data relay or direct multi-peer connections.
*   **File Sharing in Groups:** Adapt file sharing to work in a multi-peer environment.

**6. Security & Privacy:**

*   **End-to-End Encryption Review:** While WebRTC data channels are encrypted by default (DTLS), review and ensure best practices are followed. For very sensitive applications, an additional layer of application-level E2EE could be considered, though it adds complexity.
*   **User Authentication (if self-hosting more services):** If you introduce features that require a user identity beyond the ephemeral PeerID, consider simple authentication mechanisms.

**7. Code Quality & Maintainability:**

*   **Modularization:** Refactor the code in `src/index.ts` into smaller, more manageable modules (e.g., separate modules for UI handling, PeerJS logic, file transfer logic).
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Add more specific error handling throughout the application.
*   **Unit & Integration Tests:** Implement automated tests to ensure stability and prevent regressions as new features are added.

These upgrades range from relatively simple enhancements to more complex architectural changes, offering a good roadmap for evolving the project.

i-am-sushant: Awesome! Now can you tell me if this project will work even if the peers run it on two different computers across the world and try to connect? Along with that suggest me how i can make use of aws in this project.

GitHub Copilot: Let's address your questions:

**1. Will this project work if peers run it on two different computers across the world?**

**Yes, in many cases, it should work.** Here's why and what factors are involved:

*   **WebRTC & PeerJS:** The core technology, WebRTC (which PeerJS uses), is designed to enable direct peer-to-peer connections between browsers, regardless of their physical location.
*   **Signaling Server:** The initial connection setup relies on a signaling server. By default, PeerJS uses a public cloud-hosted signaling server. This server helps the two browsers discover each other and exchange the necessary information (like IP addresses and network capabilities) to attempt a direct connection.
*   **NAT Traversal (STUN/TURN):**
    *   Most computers are behind NATs (Network Address Translators), which can make direct P2P connections tricky.
    *   **STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT):** PeerJS (and WebRTC in general) uses STUN servers to help a peer discover its public IP address and the type of NAT it's behind. Public STUN servers are often used by default.
    *   **TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT):** If a direct P2P connection cannot be established (e.g., due to symmetric NATs or restrictive firewalls), a TURN server can act as a relay, forwarding data between the peers. The connection is still logically P2P, but the data packets pass through the TURN server.
*   **Success Rate:**
    *   If both peers have "friendly" NATs, a direct connection via STUN is highly likely, and it will work well globally.
    *   If one or both peers are behind more restrictive NATs, the connection might rely on a TURN server. The availability and capacity of the default public TURN servers used by PeerJS can be a factor. If no suitable TURN server is available or configured, the connection might fail.

**In short:** The project is designed for global P2P communication. The success of establishing a connection depends on the network configurations of both peers and the effectiveness of NAT traversal mechanisms (STUN/TURN). For higher reliability, especially across diverse and potentially restrictive networks, using your own well-configured TURN server is recommended (which is where AWS can come in).

**2. How can you make use of AWS in this project?**

AWS can be leveraged to enhance the reliability, scalability, and feature set of your decentralized chat application:

*   **A. Hosting the Static Web Application:**
    *   **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):** You can host the static files of your application (the `dist` folder containing `index.html`, `bundle.js`, CSS, etc.) directly on S3. This is a very cost-effective and scalable way to serve your frontend.
    *   **Amazon CloudFront:** Use CloudFront as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in front of your S3 bucket. CloudFront caches your static files at edge locations around the world, significantly reducing latency for users accessing your application globally and improving load times.
        *   *Benefit:* Faster load times for users worldwide, reduced load on a single origin.

*   **B. Self-Hosting a Signaling Server (PeerServer):**
    *   **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** You can run your own instance of PeerServer on an EC2 virtual machine. This gives you full control over the signaling process, avoids reliance on the public PeerJS server, and can improve connection setup reliability.
    *   **AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Amazon ECS/Fargate:** If you containerize your PeerServer, these services can help manage its deployment, scaling, and updates.
        *   *Benefit:* Increased reliability, control over the signaling process, no rate limits from public servers.

*   **C. Deploying a TURN Server:**
    *   **Amazon EC2 + coturn:** This is a very impactful use of AWS for this project. You can set up an open-source TURN server like `coturn` on an EC2 instance. Configuring PeerJS to use your own TURN server(s) dramatically increases the success rate of P2P connections, especially for users behind restrictive NATs.
    *   You might deploy TURN servers in different AWS regions to provide low-latency relaying for users globally.
        *   *Benefit:* Significantly higher P2P connection success rate across diverse networks.

*   **D. Domain Name & DNS:**
    *   **Amazon Route 53:** If you host your static app on S3/CloudFront and your signaling/TURN servers on EC2, you can use Route 53 to manage custom domain names for these services (e.g., `chat.yourdomain.com`, `signaling.yourdomain.com`).
        *   *Benefit:* Professional branding, easier access for users.

*   **E. (Optional) Backend for Additional Features (if moving beyond pure P2P for some aspects):**
    *   **AWS Lambda & Amazon API Gateway:** If you wanted to add features like user accounts, persistent global user profiles (beyond browser storage), or a directory of users, you could build a serverless backend.
    *   **Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon RDS:** For storing user data or other application state if you introduce centralized features.
        *   *Benefit:* Enables features that require a centralized backend, like user accounts or persistent data not tied to a single browser.

**Recommendations for AWS Integration Priority:**

1.  **Static Hosting (S3 + CloudFront):** Easy win for global accessibility and performance of the app itself.
2.  **Self-Hosted TURN Server (EC2 + coturn):** Most critical for ensuring P2P connections work reliably for users worldwide.
3.  **Self-Hosted Signaling Server (EC2/ECS):** Improves control and reliability of the connection setup phase.

By strategically using AWS services, you can make your decentralized chat application more robust, scalable, and globally accessible.

i-am-sushant: this bundle.js code is it written by coder or generated by node? It looks complicated

GitHub Copilot: You're right, the `bundle.js` file looks complicated! It's **generated by a tool, specifically webpack, based on the human-written code in your project.**

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Human-Written Source Code:**
    *   You (or the original author) wrote the application logic in TypeScript (`src/index.ts`).
    *   The project also uses JavaScript libraries like jQuery, PeerJS, etc., which were also written by developers.

2.  **The Build Process (npm run build):**
    *   When you run `npm run build`, it executes `webpack`.
    *   **Webpack's Job:**
        *   It takes your `src/index.ts` file and all the libraries it depends on.
        *   It **transpiles** the TypeScript code into JavaScript that browsers can understand.
        *   It resolves all the `import` statements and combines all the necessary JavaScript code from your files and the libraries into a single (or sometimes a few) files. This combined file is `bundle.js`.
        *   It might also perform **optimizations** like minification (removing unnecessary characters, shortening variable names) to make the file smaller, which further makes it harder to read.
        *   It includes some of its own "runtime" code to manage how the different modules (pieces of code) work together.

**Why it looks complicated:**

*   **Combination of many files:** It's not just your `index.ts`; it's that plus parts of jQuery, PeerJS, and any other dependencies, all stitched together.
*   **Transpilation:** The JavaScript in `bundle.js` is the result of converting TypeScript, which can sometimes look different from how you'd write plain JavaScript directly.
*   **Webpack's boilerplate/runtime:** Webpack adds its own code to manage the modules.
*   **Potential Minification/Optimization:** If optimizations are applied, the code is intentionally made less readable to save space.

**In short: `bundle.js` is the machine-generated output optimized for browsers, derived from the human-written source code. You typically don't edit `bundle.js` directly; you edit the source files (like `src/index.ts`) and then rebuild.**

i-am-sushant: ABOUT VULNERABLE PACKAGES

That's a very important question! The image shows that `npm audit` (or a similar tool) has found 19 vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies: 5 moderate, 11 high, and 3 critical.

**Should you worry about it?**

**Yes, generally you should be concerned, especially about high and critical vulnerabilities.**

*   **Critical and High Vulnerabilities:** These can represent serious security risks, potentially allowing attackers to compromise your application, steal data, or execute malicious code in the context of your users' browsers.
*   **Moderate Vulnerabilities:** These are less severe but can still be problematic and might be exploitable in certain scenarios or chained with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Context Matters:** The actual impact depends on:
    *   **Where the vulnerability lies:** Is it in a runtime dependency (used by the client's browser) or a development dependency (used only during the build process)? Runtime vulnerabilities are generally more critical for the end-user.
    *   **How the dependency is used:** Your project might not even use the specific part of the library that contains the vulnerability.
    *   **Exploitability:** Is there a known, easy way to exploit this vulnerability in the context of your P2P web app?

However, it's best practice to address known vulnerabilities to maintain a secure application.

**How can you set it up to use the latest dependencies?**

Here's a general approach to updating dependencies and addressing vulnerabilities:

1.  **Review the Audit Report:**
    *   Run `npm audit` in your terminal in the decentralized-chat directory. This will give you a detailed report of each vulnerability, which package it's in, and sometimes suggested fixes or which version resolves it.

2.  **Attempt Automatic Fixes (Cautiously):**
    *   `npm audit fix`: This command will try to automatically update vulnerable dependencies to a version that fixes the vulnerability, but only if it can do so without breaking your project (i.e., it usually only updates to compatible minor or patch versions).
    *   `npm audit fix --force`: This will attempt more aggressive updates, potentially including major version bumps that *could* introduce breaking changes. **Use with caution and test thoroughly afterward.**

3.  **Manual Updates (Often Necessary for Major Versions or Complex Cases):**
    *   **Identify Problematic Packages:** From the `npm audit` report, note which packages have the most critical vulnerabilities.
    *   **Check for Breaking Changes:** Before updating a package, especially to a new major version (e.g., from `1.x.x` to `2.x.x`), visit the package's official documentation or GitHub repository. Look for release notes, changelogs, or migration guides. Major versions often introduce breaking changes that will require you to update your own code.
    *   **Update Specific Packages:**
        *   To update a package to its latest version: `npm install <package-name>@latest` (e.g., `npm install peerjs@latest`).
        *   To update to a specific version: `npm install <package-name>@<version-number>`
    *   **Update All Packages (More Risky):** You can try `npm update`, which attempts to update packages to their latest minor/patch versions allowed by your `package.json` ranges. For major updates, you'd typically need to edit `package.json` or use `npm install <package-name>@latest`.
    *   **Tools like `npm-check-updates`:** This tool can help you see which packages have newer versions available and can assist in updating your `package.json`.
        ```bash
        npx npm-check-updates -u
        npm install
        ```
        This will update your `package.json` to the latest versions, and then `npm install` will install them. Again, **test thoroughly for breaking changes.**

4.  **Test, Test, Test:**
    *   After any dependency update, thoroughly test your application. Check all core functionalities: connecting to peers, sending/receiving messages, sending/receiving files, UI interactions, etc.
    *   Look for errors in the browser console.

**Specific Considerations for This Project:**

*   **Older Dependencies:** This project uses some older versions (e.g., `webpack@4`, `typescript@3`). Updating these to their latest major versions (e.g., `webpack@5`, `typescript@5`) will almost certainly involve breaking changes and require modifications to your `webpack.config.js` and `tsconfig.json`, and potentially your TypeScript code.
*   **PeerJS:** If PeerJS itself has vulnerabilities, updating it might be critical. Check its changelog for any API changes.
*   **jQuery & Bootstrap:** These are also older versions. Updating them might require changes to your HTML structure or JavaScript code that interacts with them.

**Recommendation:**

1.  Start by running `npm audit` to understand the details.
2.  Try `npm audit fix`.
3.  For remaining high and critical vulnerabilities, investigate each one.
    *   Prioritize updating runtime dependencies that are directly involved in the P2P communication or UI.
    *   Be prepared to spend time reading documentation and potentially refactoring code if you decide to update major versions of core dependencies like webpack, TypeScript, or PeerJS.
4.  Update one major dependency at a time and test, rather than trying to update everything at once.

It's a balance between security and the effort required to update and refactor. For critical vulnerabilities, the effort is usually justified.
